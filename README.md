# Computer Vision Project: GAN-based Data Augmentation for Chest X-ray Classification

- Cloned from [this repository](https://github.com/ssundaram21/6.819FinalProjectRAMP)
- Paper: https://arxiv.org/pdf/2107.02970.pdf

## Datasets
- [Covid-chestxray dataset](https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/paultimothymooney/chest-xray-pneumonia)
- [RSNA Pneumonia](https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/paultimothymooney/chest-xray-pneumonia) 

The datasets would be stored under the `data` directory. To downalodad the datasets in your terminal, simply run `bash bash_scripts/run_data.py`
